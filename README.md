# horiseon-code-refactoring

## Description

This project was refactoring the Horiseon website to condense the code. I took the various elements in the html and converted them over into semantic tags. There were several elements in the CSS that became surperfluious and were able to be done with just the element tags rather then a series of class tags. There were also several sets in the CSS that had seperate classes that all did the same function, I converted all of those into single classes and condesed the repeating CSS code down into single functions.
